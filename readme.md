GazelleUI is a web based torrent manager a-la CouchPotato, Headphones, or SickRage, but just for [Gazelle](https://github.com/WhatCD/Gazelle) based music trackers (such as APL or PTH). It serves as a web wrapper for Gazelle's API, and downloads torrents into a folder that can be 'watched' by any torrent client for instant downloading.

It's minimal, it's fast, and it works on your phone. What more do you want.

## Installation

If you've got it, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the best way to run GazelleUI.

    docker create \
      --name=gazelleui \
      --restart always \
      -v <path to watchfolder>:/torrents \
      -v <path to config>:/app/config \
      -e PGID=1000 -e PUID=1000  \
      -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles \
      -p 2020:2020 \
      xanderstrike/gazelleui

* Set the watchfolder to a directory watched by your torrent client
* PGID and PUID can be found by running `id` in a terminal
* Timezone is your timezone
* Configure the port by setting `2020:2020` to `<your port>:2020`

Run with:

    docker start gazelleui

There's also a docker-compose.yml if you prefer that.

### Without Docker or for Development

GazelleUI is designed with seedboxes in mind. These instructions are for Ubuntu, but it'll run on most any linux or osx box.
